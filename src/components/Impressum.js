        <br />
        The data processing on this website is carried out by the website
        operator. How do we collect your data? On the one hand, your data is
        collected when you communicate it to us. This can be e.g. data that you

        systems when you visit the website. This is primarily technical data
        (e.g. internet browser, operating system or time of the page view). This
        data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>What do we use your data for?</b>
        <br />
        <br /> Part of the data is collected to ensure that the website is
        provided without errors. Other data can be used to analyze your user
        behavior.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>What rights do you have regarding your data? </b>
        <br />

        <span class="nes-text is-primary">EXTERNAL HOSTING </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        This website is hosted by an external service provider (hoster).
        Personal data collected on this website is stored on the host's servers.
        This can primarily be IP addresses, contact requests, meta and
        communication data, contract data, contact data, names, website access
        and other data generated via a website. The hoster is used for the
        purpose of fulfilling the contract with our potential and existing

        fast and efficient provision of our online offer by a professional
        provider (Art. 6 Para 1 lit. f GDPR). Our hoster will only process your

        <span class="nes-text is-primary">PRIVACY</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
        very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in
        accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data
        protection declaration. If you use this website, various personal data
        will be collected. Personal data is data with which you can be
        personally identified. This data protection declaration explains what
        data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for
        what purpose this happens. We would like to point out that data
        transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can
        have security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by
        third parties is not possible. <br />

          REVOCATION OF YOUR CONSENT TO DATA PROCESSING

        <br /> Many data processing operations are only possible with your
        express consent. You can revoke consent that you have already given at
        any time. An informal message by e-mail to us is sufficient. The
        legality of the data processing that took place up until the revocation
        remains unaffected by the revocation.

        GDPR. IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU

        DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
        PROFILING TO THE EXTENT RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU

        In the event of violations of the GDPR, those affected have the right to

        or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request
        the direct transfer of the data to another person responsible, this will
        only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible. <br />

        the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can
        recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of
        the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol
        in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data
        that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.{" "}

        is required for payment processing. Payment transactions using the usual
        means of payment (Visa/MasterCard, direct debit) are carried out
        exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognize an
